# Meridian School - Simple Static Website

This is a small static website (HTML + CSS + image) for "Meridian School". Use it for demo or as a starting point.

## What's included
- index.html
- styles.css
- logo.png

## How to publish for free (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one): https://github.com
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `meridian-school-site`) and upload the files from this zip.
   - You can drag-and-drop the files in the GitHub web UI.
3. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages** (or "Pages" in the sidebar).
4. Under "Build and deployment", choose "Deploy from a branch", select the branch `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`, then click Save.
5. GitHub will provide a free `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` link after deployment (may take a minute).

## Alternative free hosts
- Netlify: drag-and-drop site folder to get a free link.
- GitLab Pages, Vercel (also have free tiers).

If you'd like, I can:
- Customize text/colors/sections right now.
- Create versions (dark/light), or add more pages (Teachers, Events).
